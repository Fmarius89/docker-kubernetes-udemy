Reference notes

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform or ecosystem for creating and running containers. 

## What is a container? 

Docker works with images which are files that contain all dependencies and configuration files for running a program. <b>When an image is running or when it is instantiated then we say we have a container</b>. Containers have its own isolated configuration of hardware, that is, the hardware from your computer is not related to the hardware of the image. 

## Why use Docker?

Docker makes it simple to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependency libraries. 

## Useful commands to know in Docker

### `docker run <image_name>` 

Execute an image container with docker.

### `docker-compose up` 

It is used to start multiple Docker containers at the same time.

### `docker ps`

It lists all the containers that are currently running. 

### `docker ps -a`

Same as `docker ps` but with more detailed information.

### `docker ps --all`

Lists all the containers that were executed.

### `docker rmi <image_id>`

Remove a docker image from the docker image cache by providing the image_id.

### `docker rmi <name_of_the_container>`

Remove a docker image from the docker image cache by providing the name of the container.

## How does Docker work?

When you initialize an image,i.e., `docker run hello-world`, the docker client in your machine checks if you already have that image in your image cache and if this is not the case then the docker client contacts the docker server so this one contacts the DockerHub to request the image, then the image is stored in your image cache so you can have it ready the next time you want to execute it.

## Containers

Remember that a container is an instance of an image that is running. Suppose we want to run a legacy program that needs Python 2.7 and you need to use Chrome which needs needs Python 3.7. How do you setup these 2 Python versions in one same machine? You can use containers to maintain both versions of Python.

     ________________________________________ 
    |  Conatiner A           Container B     |
    |   ----------------    --------------   |
    |  | Legacy program |  |   Chrome     |  |
    |  |      |         |  |      |       |  |
    |  |      v         |  |      v       |  |
    | -------------------------------------- |
    | ||  Python 2.7    |  |   Python 3.7 || |
    | ||                |  |              || |
    | | ----------------    -------------- | |
    | |              Hard Disk             | |
    | |------------------------------------| |
    | ______________________________________ |

Both versions of Python are stored in the Hard disk because a <b>namespace</b> or dedicated space in your disk was dedicated for both versions. Container A has isolated resources and processes for executing Python 2.7 without interfering the processes and resources for Container B. 

Remember that namespacing and control groups belong to Linux and when you install Docker in Windows or MACOS, a Linux virtual machine gets installed so you can use the namespacing and control groups.

## Images

An image has a file system snapshot, dependencies and startup commands to execute a program.

Note that <i>image_id</i> or <i>container_id</i> are used indistinctible in the following commands but just recap that a container is an image which is being executed. 

Docker command to create an image.

### `docker create <image_name> <command>`

Docker command to start an image.

### `docker start -a <image_id>`

Docker command to create and start an image at the same time.

### `docker run <image_name>`

Erase all the containers that were executed and remove images from the image cache.

### `docker system prune`

Review the logs of a container

### `docker logs <container_id>`

Stop a container 

### `docker stop <container_id>`

Stop a container immediately

### `docker kill <container_id>`

Execute a command in a container (you need to open another terminal tab and run this command while the container is up).

### `docker exec -it <container_id> <command_to_run>`

Start a shell in the container.

### `docker exec -it <container_id> sh`

## How to create your own images in Docker?

In order to run your images as containers you need to create a Dockerfile by:

1. Specifying a base image.
2. Executing some commands to add extra software.
3. Specifying commands to initialize the image as a container when the system starts.

This is a classic example of how to write a Docker file:

### FROM alpine
### RUN apk add --update redis
### CMD ["redis-server"]

In the lines from above, I am specifying to the Docker server to use alpine to download a set of pre-installed programs, then Docker updates redis and initializes the redis server. 

This is how you can build your image once you have set up the docker file.

## `docker build .`

This is what happens when you build your image:

            |_______________________________________|  

The image gets built and a specific portion of RAM, CPU and processes have been created as well as a file system. Once the image is running, which is a container, it interacts with your machine so you can execute your desired instructions. 

Tag your docker images

## `docker build -t alejandro/pythonprogram:latest .`

Port mapping - this is a very important topic because once your container is up and running, you can get access to it either through the shell or by a port, that is, in your browser you can see the results of your container. The first port is your machine port and the second port is the port from your container.

## `docker run -p 3001:8080 alejandro/pythonprogram`

Debug a container by getting access to its shell:

## `docker run -it alejandro/pythonprogram sh`

Debug a container by getting access to its shell when it is already running:

## `docker exec -it <image_id> sh`

## Run multiple Docker containers with Docker Compose

Docker compose allows us to start multiple Docker containers at the same time, for instance, if we want to start a redis server and a node server then we can create this in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

Execute the `.yml` file to initialize the multiple containers.

## `docker-compose up` 

Rebuild the docker file image.

## `docker build .`

Rebuild the `.yml` file and initialize the multiple containers.

## `docker-compose up --build`

Start all your docker images and put them in the background.

## `docker-compose up -d`

Shutdown the multiple docker containers.

## `docker-compose down`

Rebuild a single docker image (Dockerfile.dev). We usually use this command with the -f for rebuilding the .dev file.

## `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`


## Docker volumes

Whenever we edit any file from the local folder, then we have to rebuild the image with docker to reflect the changes but you can use docker volumes to avoid this step.

                _________________         _____________________
               |                 |       |                     |
               |   Local folder  |       |   Docker container  |
                -----------------        ----------------------|
               |    frontend     |  <--- |      reference      |
               |-----------------|       |---------------------|
               |      /src       |  <--- |      reference      |
               |_________________|       |_____________________|


The docker volumes can be initialized in the `.yml` file or by terminal command with:

## `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id> 

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
